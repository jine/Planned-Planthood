*Note: This implementation summary was generated by AI.*

## Git History Summary

The development of Planned Planthood began with basic HTML structure and semantic elements, followed by initial CSS styling using Open Sans font from Google Fonts. The project evolved through several key phases:

- **Initial Setup**: Added basic semantic HTML structure, CSS classes, and initial grid layouts for images and plant cards.
- **Layout Evolution**: Transitioned from flexbox to CSS Grid for better layout control, particularly for plant cards and overall page structure.
- **Accessibility Enhancements**: Implemented skip links, ARIA labels, semantic navigation, and screen reader support. Added tabindex management and aria-hidden attributes for better accessibility.
- **Responsive Design**: Added media queries for tablet and mobile views, with hamburger menu dialog for mobile navigation.
- **Styling Refinements**: Refined spacing, typography, colors, and interactions. Added hover/focus states, transitions, and consistent theming using CSS custom properties.
- **Content and Features**: Added plant cards with tags, author information, newsletter signup, and footer with contact details.
- **Final Polish**: Removed redundant CSS, optimized layouts, and ensured cross-browser compatibility.
